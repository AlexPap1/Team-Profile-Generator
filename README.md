## 🖊️ Description 🖊️
<br />

This application will generate an html file which will display the members of a working team consisting of a single Manager, and any amount of Engineers or Interns.
<br />
USER STORY: As a manager I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
<br />
Each job has inputs for a role, name, email address, and ID. The emails will link directly to their address. Managers have a space for office number, Engineers have a space for GitHub user (which creates a direct link to their github profile), and Interns have a space for their school.
